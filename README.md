## General Information
- A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state. 

- In such an attempt, BoomBikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19. They have planned this to prepare themselves to cater to the people's needs once the situation gets better all around and stand out from other service providers and make huge profits.

- Trying to find Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
- How well those variables describe the bike demands
- Company provided with data set containing details about the bookins per day for two years.


## Conclusions
- As per our final Model, the top 3 predictor variables that influences the bike booking are:
- Temperature (temp) - A coefficient value of ‘0.5636’ indicated that a unit increase in temp variable increases the bike hire numbers by 0.5636 units. 
- Weather Situation 3 (weathersit_3) - A coefficient value of ‘-0.3070’ indicated that, w.r.t Weathersit1, a unit increase in Weathersit3 variable decreases the bike hire numbers by 0.3070 units. 
- Year (yr) - A coefficient value of ‘0.2308’ indicated that a unit increase in yr variable increases the bike hire numbers by 0.2308 units. So, it's suggested to consider these variables utmost importance while planning, to achive maximum Booking.



## Technologies Used
